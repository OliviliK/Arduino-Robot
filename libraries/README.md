#Arduino-Robot Libraries
All these libraries use the best Arduino practices.  This includes the following
 * All h-files have the #ifndef protection
 * All h-files have only declarations and no data allocations
 * The h-file and cpp-file have the same name as the library
 * There is a h-file related keyrords.txt in every library with the following logic
    * KEYWORD1 for datatypes and class names
    * KEYWORD2 for methods and functions
    * KEYWORD3 for enumerations
    * LITERAL1 for constants
 * There is examples directory with ino-files to demonstrate the library usage
