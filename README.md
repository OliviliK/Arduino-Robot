# arduino-robot
Arduino code used in teaching robots: 
  * 6-wheel Mars Rover with 12 sensors, inluding IMU and ultrasonic sensor array
  * 4-wheel robot with Lidar
  * 2-wheel robot with ESP8266
  
The target cost of the 6-wheel rocker-bogie robot is under $150.

The 4-wheel robot uses aluminum parts and higher level components with advanced mapping capabilities. Its target cost is below $300.

The 2-wheel robot has minimum number of sensors.  It can act as an web server or web client and can be controlled by cell phones and similar Wi-Fi devices.  It can be programmed for swarm operations supported by external cameras connected to Raspberry PI and similar hosts. Its target cost is below $50.
